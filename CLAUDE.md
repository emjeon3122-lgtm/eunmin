# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository status

This repository is currently empty (no commits, no source files). There is no existing build system, test suite, or architecture to document yet. Update this file as real code, structure, and tooling get added so future guidance stays accurate.

## Coding guidelines

- **BAT file encoding**: When creating `.bat` files that contain Korean (한글) text, be careful with character encoding. Windows batch files default to the system codepage (often CP949/EUC-KR on Korean Windows, not UTF-8), which can corrupt Korean text (mojibake) if the file is saved as UTF-8 without a matching `chcp` setting. Either save as CP949/ANSI to match the default codepage, or add `chcp 65001` at the top of the script and save the file as UTF-8 (without BOM) if UTF-8 is required — and verify it actually displays correctly in `cmd.exe`, not just in an editor.
- **Efficiency**: Always write efficient code — avoid unnecessary loops, redundant computation, or repeated I/O/network calls when a simpler or cached approach works.
- **No hardcoding**: Do not hardcode values that vary by environment or deployment (paths, credentials, hostnames, ports, magic constants). Use configuration, environment variables, or parameters instead.
- **Security**: Always consider security when writing code — validate/sanitize external input, avoid injection vulnerabilities (command, SQL, script), and never commit secrets or credentials.
